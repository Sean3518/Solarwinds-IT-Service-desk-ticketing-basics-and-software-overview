</p>
<p>
managing tickets is one of the first services in this software that is very simple and easy to use, as you can see from this organized and elegant dashboard its very easy to navigate, so here we will navigate to the left task bar, click on the ticket icon that says "service desk" and click "incidents".
</p>

</p>
<p>
from this window, it displays all of your active tickets/incidents, as you can see they are very well organized and by title, priority level, origin, category and the user the ticket was assigned too, this makes the system easy to keep track of tasks. from we will click on one of the tickets on screen.

</p>
<p>
in this ticket here we can see that the user is unable to login for unknown reasons due to the fact that he has not given us enough information, the next step would be to reach out to the affected user to inquire more on this issue, for story purposes lets say the situation is the user had too many failed password attempts and has locked himself out of his account, so we would fix his issue and respond to and clear the ticket by putting in the comments how we resolved the issue, this is very important for you and others to solve future tickets, type in your response in the comments section and down at the bottom click "post" and now this ticket has been resolved.
</p>

</p>
<p>
in this demonstration here this is the result of having clicked the plus icon on the top right when you are on the all incidents screen, you can also create tickets for walk in prospects as well as you know you need tickets for every IT problem you solve as a professional for the purpose of tracking activities and recording known solutions, here you can create tickets and assign them to departments, adjust the severity levels as well the category it belongs to and even assign them to as user, once you are done filling out the form you simply press the blue "create" button at the bottom of the screen and that are the basics of the most important piece of why this software is very beneficial and powerful to use, being as its SAAS and cloud based you can use it anywhere and its always going to be on the latest version.
